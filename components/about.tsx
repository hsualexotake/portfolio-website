      <p className="mb-3">
        From a young age, my passion for online gaming fueled a curiosity about the technology 
        that powered my gaming experiences. Initially, I focused on upgrading my computer's hardware 
        to gain a competitive edge. As I began assembling my own machines, this fascination only grew. 
        However, when financial constraints limited further hardware upgrades, I turned to software 
        solutions. I learned to maximize performance through software solutions like GPU overclocking and 
        driver optimization. This shift towards harnessing softwareâ€™s full potential deepened my appreciation 
        for its capabilities, inspiring me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at NYU.
